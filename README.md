# Features
Fast11 is a very customizable application, allowing you to customize your ISO however you want. You can change these options:

----------------------------------------------

# Installation Process
First, once you open it, Fast11 will begin downloading the nesscesary files needed for use. It downloads:
- Default Template Configuration File (recommended for non tech-savvy users)
- Windows 11 24H2 ISO (will be deleted later with the new, edited ISO)
- Nesscesary Powershell Scripts (needed for executing functions)

----------------------------------------------

# What's Different?
You may be like "well, why can't I just use Win11Debloater or CCWinUtil?" and, your correct. But, the thing with Fast11 is that you do not have to even run this on a newly installed Windows 11 machine. It does it all for you, before you even install it.

This makes it great for mass deployment and just simple ISOs that include all the apps, tweaks, and configurations to your preference. A lot of Windows Debloaters need you to run it **after installation** which makes it a bit harder because it takes up most of your time and is confusing. Luckily, Talon (created by RavenDevTeam) is a problem solver to this, but you still need to run it after installation, which some people don't like. Most tech-savvy people prefer to just have a minimalized ISO, ready to go with all their applications, tweaks, and configuration.

# Credits
I want to give a **big** shoutout to Talon, the whole inspiration for me to make this project. Talon kind of inspired me to make a Windows Debloater, beacause 1, I want to test my programming skills on an actual project and not just things I would quit on after like a week.

The main contributions to this project are:
- LiamDoesVR - Main Developer
- pxrgatory - Helps with functions & writes the README
