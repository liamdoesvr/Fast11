# Features
Fast11 is an extremely customizable application, where you can change any of the settings/modifications you need to configure your ISO file. The items you can change are...

- Create a pre-modified ISO file
- Install custom applications
- Easy to use interface
- Configure Windows Settings straight from the ISO file
- 5+ pre-set profiles
- Customizable tweaks

... and much more!

# Installation Process
After you run the application, Fast11 will download it's necessary files to start the modification process. Fast11 will download...

- Fast11's Default Configuration File
- Windows 11 (24H2)
- Windows Powershell Scripts (needed for executing functions)

# Differences
You probably asked yourself, "Well, why can't I just use Win11Debloater or CCWinUtil?" and that is a great question.

The main difference between Fast11 and the other Windows debloater apps is that Fast11 configures your Windows 11 installation before it's installed on any device, meanwhile the other ones configures it after installation.

This makes it great for mass deployment and just simple ISOs that include all the apps, tweaks, and configurations to your preference. A lot of Windows Debloaters need you to run it ***after installation***, which causes you to waste your time and probably confuse you from how many stuff you can change. Luckily, Talon (created by RavenDevTeam) is a problem solver to this, but you still need to run it after installation, which some people don't like.

Most tech-savvy people prefer to just have a minimalized ISO, ready to go with all their applications, tweaks, and configuration.

# Credits
I want to give a big shoutout to Talon, the whole inspiration for me to make this project. Talon inspired me to make a Windows Debloater, beacause I want to test my programming skills on an actual project and not just things I would quit on after like a week.

The main contributions to this project are:
- LiamDoesVR - Fast11 Developer
- pxrgatory - Github Repository Editor

# How It Works
The Fast11 application will gives you a variety of Profiles that you can choose from, that modifies different tweaks & applications to make it more appealing for that specific profile.

Once the profile is selected, 2 ISO files are created, one that doesn't have any changes to the installation media, and one that has all the modifications completed for when you install the ISO file to any computer. The original ISO file will be deleted shortly after the modified version has been created.

Some profiles you can install are...

- [PLACEHOLDER]
- [PLACEHOLDER]
- [PLACEHOLDER]
- [PLACEHOLDER]

... and a few more.

# Conclusion
To summarize what you just read, Fast11 is a fast, reliable, and useful application to download modified/profiled ISO files of Windows 11 and download the files straight onto your computer in seconds. Our application will be beneficiary towards large businesses, software developers, artists, programmers, and tons more.
