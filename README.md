# Features
Fast11 is a extremely customizable application, where you can change any of the settings/modifications you need to configure your ISO file. The items you can change are:

- Create a pre-modified ISO file
- Install custom applications
- Easy to use interface
- Configure Windows Settings straight from the ISO file
- 5+ pre-set profiles
- Customizable tweaks

... and much more!

# Installation Process
First, once you open it, Fast11 will begin downloading the nesscesary files needed for use. It downloads:
- Default Template Configuration File (recommended for non tech-savvy users)
- Windows 11 24H2 ISO (will be deleted later with the new, edited ISO)
- Nesscesary Powershell Scripts (needed for executing functions)

# What's Different?
You might be asking a question like... "Well, why can't I just use Win11Debloater or CCWinUtil?" The thing is with Fast11, all of the modifications come pre-built into the ISO file you created from running the application.

This makes it great for mass deployment and just simple ISOs that include all the apps, tweaks, and configurations to your preference. A lot of Windows Debloaters need you to run it **after installation** which makes it a bit harder because it takes up most of your time and is confusing. Luckily, Talon (created by RavenDevTeam) is a problem solver to this, but you still need to run it after installation, which some people don't like. Most tech-savvy people prefer to just have a minimalized ISO, ready to go with all their applications, tweaks, and configuration.

# Credits
I want to give a **big** shoutout to Talon, the whole inspiration for me to make this project. Talon inspired me to make a Windows Debloater, beacause I want to test my programming skills on an actual project and not just things I would quit on after like a week.

The main contributions to this project are:
- LiamDoesVR - Main & Only Developer
- pxrgatory - Makes up Ideas & Writes the `README.md` file

# How it works
The Fast11 application will gives you a variety of Profiles that you can choose from, that modifies different tweaks & applications to make it more appealing for that specific profile. Once the profile is selected, 2 ISO files are created, one that doesn't have any changes to the installation media, and one that has all the modifications completed for when you install the ISO file to any computer.

# That's it!
To summarize what you just read, Fast11 is a fast, reliable, and useful application to download modified/profiled ISO files of Windows 11 and download the files straight onto your computer in seconds. Our application will be beneficiary towards large businesses, software developers, artists, programmers, and tons more.
