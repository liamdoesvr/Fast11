# Fast11

Fast11 is a tool made by LiamDoesVR, that allows users to customize and tweak their Windows 11 Installation before they even install it. This makes it easy for users to just click the apps they want to install, and install Windows.


## Features

- Can edit a Windows installation before you even install it
- Gets rid of bloatware pre-installed automatically
- Lets you customize a Windows 11 install (removing edge, etc..)
- Installation Presets (basic, professional, student, etc..)
- Installs basic applications without you needing to touch anything



## How to use
> [!INFO]
> Launching Fast11 for the first time may take awhile as it needs to download the nesscesary configuartion and ISO files.

Download the latest release from releases, and make sure to **run it as administrator**, or else the registry tweaks and other tweaks **will not work**. Once opened, Fast11 will automatically begin downloading and configurating your Windows Installation.

1. First, it will create some log files for debugging purposes. You can find these at (the folder or place you ran the program)/Fast11Data/Logs/log_timestamp.
2. Second, it will download the basic configuration files off of this GitHub page.
3. Third, it will download the Windows 11 24H2 ISO, and will give you a percentage based on completion.
4. Fourth, it will extract the installation files off of the ISO once it's done downloading.
5. Fifth, It will start to copy over the installation files to your system. This can take awhile.
6. Sixth, it will finish up, check for updates, and do some background checks like Administrator Permissions.
